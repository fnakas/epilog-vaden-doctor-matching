# Symptom-based Doctor Matching Web App for Vaden Health Services using Logic Programming
 
Final Project for Stanford's CS 151 course: Logic Programming.
Authors: Tiantian Fang, Farzaan Kaiyom, Filippos Nakas


Web app that asks users for their currently experienced symptoms and other preferences (location, time availability, etc.) in order to match them with Vaden Health Doctors given their specialty. Build solely using html and logic programming in epilog. For details please see the accompanied paper.

Note: the epilog plug-in is currently not functioning for some reason and the web-page cannot be launched. However, the logic program can be found in the bottom of the html file and can run in the epilog interpreter (changing the ground atoms using actions is analogous to inserting user input in the webpage).
